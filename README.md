## Introduction
  The task was to build a program to simulate a set of flashCards through the command line in your terminal. You should be greeted by a welcome message, shown the number of cards in the deck, and be prompted with your first question! Please follow the [instructions](#instructions) below on how to begin!


## Instructions

#### 1. Fork This Repo

On the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.

#### 2. Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

Running `node index.js` will get you started on your first of many questions!
**Good Luck!**

## Live Action - Get your quiz on!

Once you are working through Iteration 3, you will want to start your server to test your functionality.
In the terminal, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

When the game has started, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:

You can entire your answer by using the arrow keys or entering the number, the pressing enter!

You will then be alerted if our answer was correct or incorrect. To move to the next question, simply press enter again!

Enjoy!

## Project Goals & Objectives

- Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Challenges & Wins

### Challenges

- At first I struggled with the concept of testing, I wanted to test each line individually. After a little bit of productive struggle I found it was best to test each method with their outcomes. Rather building certain tests that may initial pass and the fail later on as the method has since been modified to pass the following tests!

### Wins

- I dove right into this project! When it was introduced I was a little overwhelmed, but I jumped in and everything started falling into place! I feel really great with the outcome
- Completing a few extensions... TBD ~~~~~~
